This package was assembled by Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>,
based on previous work by Martin Mitchell <martin@debian.org>.

The Debian packaging of TiMidity++ is:
  Copyright (c) 2003 by Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>,
  Copyright (c) 2002 by Martin Mitchell <martin@debian.org>,
  and distributed in the same license as the upstream source it applies to.

Upstream sources are at: http://www.timidity.jp/
Sourceforge project at:  http://timidity.sourceforge.net/

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted of adding various
debian/* files to the distribution, as well as minor changes to the
configuration files.

This package was formerly maintained by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>,
and Martin Mitchell <martin@debian.org>.
