High priority:
 - safe timidity sequencer (cheuid)
 - verify mime handling
 - fix upstream crap of a build system, that is overriding all of
   our cflags/cppflags.

 - autobuild logs show problems with the Tk Interface build
 - mipsel autobuild fails due to retarded link of X crap in
   "calcnewt" that is a build-time exec tool

Low priority:
 - Realtime scheduling
 - slow-cpu version of timidity (linear interpol, etc)
 - sequencer: ALSASEQ variable, set it?
